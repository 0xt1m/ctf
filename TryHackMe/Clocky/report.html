        <h1>Clock</h1>
    
        <p>From <code>nmap</code> I know that there is a few open ports: 22, 80, 3324, 8000, 8080</p>
    
        <img src="./imgs/port80.png" alt="">
        <p>Looks like we cannot really access it. Same on port 8000.</p>
        <p>I went to <code>robots.txt</code> on port 8000 and found the first flag</p>
        <img src="./imgs/flag1.png" alt="">
        <p>Let's run ffuf to find more pathes.</p>
        <code>ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt -u "http://clocky.thm:8000/FUZZ.zip" -c -t 300</code>
        <p>I used this command and found index.zip file. <br>Let's check it out.</p>
        <p>Now we got the second flag</p>
        <p>Let's check the app.py file</p>
        <p>
            Here is couple of interesting things:<br>
            <pre>
            connection = pymysql.connect(host="localhost",
                                        user="clocky_user",
                                        password=db,
                                        db="clocky",
                                        cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.DictCursor)
            </pre><br>
            <pre>
                1. @app.route("/administrator", methods=["GET", "POST"])
                2. @app.route("/forgot_password", methods=["GET", "POST"])
                3. @app.route("/password_reset", methods=["GET"])
            </pre><br>
            
            <pre>
                # Not done (11/05-2023, <strong>clarice</strong>)
                # user_provided_token = request.args.get("TEMPORARY")
            </pre><br>
        </p>

        Also, from the app.py file we know that the app is running on port 8080.
            <img src="./imgs/port8080.png" alt=""><br>
            
            <p>These are the most interesting lines in the code for us:</p><br>
            <img src="./imgs/interesting.png" alt="">
            <p>
                Let's break it down. <br>
                It takes current time than adds " . " and username in uppercase. So in result before hasing the line would look like this: <br>
                <code>2024-05-14 14:36:49.21 . CHARLIE</code> <br>
                Than it hashes it, so eventually it looks like this: <br>
                <code>79f916cf80f25b31cc1e79f1fe578410d0525f52</code> <br>
                And then the line becomes a new token for the username. <br>
                
                I am going to try to write a python script that will do 3 things: <br>
                1. Capture the time <br>
                2. Create the a token <br>
                3. Make a post request to the page to update the token for particular user. <br>
    
                The problem is that I am not sure if that is going to be fast enough. The other way is to bruteforce it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This way it didn't work, so I am going to create a script that will create all possible hashes for the last 10 seconds.
