<h2>I created a random user</h2>
<p><img alt="dima" src="./imgs/dima.png" /></p>
<h2>admin.php</h2>
<p>There is an admin login page that looks just like the default login page. However, the new user doesn't work.
<img alt="admin" src="./imgs/admin.png" /></p>
<h2>BurpSuite</h2>
<p>I opened BurpSuite and decided to go through different pages and see what I can do.
Later on I found something interesting on the register page.

<h2>Admin Role</h2>
<p>I set <code>roleid</code> to <code>1</code> than went to the <code>admin.php</code> and got in.

<h2>Subdomain</h2>
<p>That's where I found a subdomain.
<img alt="dev-staging" src="./imgs/dev-staging.png" />
It looks like a page where we can see all the logs.
Discovering a little bit more I realized that it was the <code>laravel</code> framework. Than I found an exploit <code>CVE-2018-15133</code> and used it to get a shell.</p>
<h2>User Flag</h2>
<p>Reading this file: <code>/var/www/html/academy/.env</code> I found a password for user <code>cry0l1t3</code> and sshed into it.
Interesting that the user is part of group <code>adm</code>.</p>
<h2>Root</h2>
<p>In order to, not to spend too much time I used the hint and found that I had to read the audit logs. Using a tool called: <code>aureport</code> and the next command:
<code>aureport --tty</code>
I found a password to user <code>mrb3n</code></p>
<p>Then, using <code>sudo -l</code> I found that the user can execute <code>composer</code> as a root. Than I found how to exploit it to get root.
